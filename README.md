Parses SimpleCov output and submits the result to Codacy

## Setup

Include the gem in your project

```
gem 'codacy-coverage', :require => false
```

In the first line of your spec_helper initialize the reporter:

```
require 'codacy-coverage'

Codacy::Reporter.start
```


#### Configuration

To update Codacy, you will need your project API token. You can find the token in Project -> Settings -> Integrations -> Project API.

Then set it in your terminal, replacing %Project_Token% with your own token:

```
export CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN=%Project_Token%
```

By default this plugin will not submit results if you run your tests in localhost. If you want to force the submission you can setup the following environment variable:

```
export CODACY_RUN_LOCAL=true
```

Note: You should keep your API token well **protected**, as it grants owner permissions to your projects.

#### Running Tests

When you run your tests, the plugin will send the coverage info to Codacy.

For example, run the following commands:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

This will install the required dependencies. Then just run the tests:

```
bundle exec rspec
```

By default, the debug info will be logged into a file. If you want the debug info to be printed to stdout you can:

```
export DEBUG_STDOUT=true
```

You can now check your coverage results in the Codacy dashboard of your project.
